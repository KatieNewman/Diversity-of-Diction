# Data
Three mediums of creative writing analyzed were: song lyrics, poems, and journal articles. Five well-known works for each of five artists were selected for analysis. A process of "web scrapping" was used to obtain the words for each of the 75 works. Tools like Beautiful Soup, Python, urllib, Requests were used to parse the HTML of the websites containing the works.
